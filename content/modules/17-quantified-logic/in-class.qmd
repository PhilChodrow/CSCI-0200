---

## Exercise

Consider the following two statements: 

1. Everything is awesome!!! 
2. Everything is cool when you're part of a team. 

Translate these statements using quantified logical expressions, using the following predicates: 

- $A(x)$: $x$ is awesome. 
- $C(y)$: $y$ is cool. 
- $P(z, t)$: person $z$ is part of team $t$.
