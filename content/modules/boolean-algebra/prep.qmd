# Reading (~20 mins)

*This reading is pretty dense and it's ok to skim as long as you're ready for the warmup problems.*

*Please complete these problems with a pencil/pen and paper. Then, scan/photograph your solutions and upload them to Canvas.*

- How is Boolean algebra *different* from propositional logic? How is it similar?
- Here's an expression, translate it into Boolean logic (3 variables). 
- Here's an expression, simplify it as much as you can (down to a specified minimum) (3 variables).
