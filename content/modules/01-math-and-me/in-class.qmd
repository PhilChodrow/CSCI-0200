### Your Affinity Vegetable

<br> <br> 

### 1. Split into teams

### 2. Go around and share your name and:

##### If you were a vegetable, which vegetable would you be [and why]{.alert}? 

## {background-image="../../../assets/img/pics/veggies.jpeg" background-size="contain" background-color="black"}

### Your Affinity Vegetable

<br> <br> 

### 3. [Team leader]{.alert}: lead your team in finding a [*delicious dish*]{.alert2} that incorporates all of your vegetables.

##### Be ready to share! 


##  

### First, just write (4 minutes)

<br> <br> 

What's a way in which your previous classmates have helped you feel [**welcome**]{.alert-2} or [**supported in your learning**]{.alert-2}? 

<br> 

What's a way in which your previous classmates have made you feel [**unwelcome**]{.alert-4} or [**discouraged in your learning**]{.alert-4}?




## 

### In Groups (8 mins)

<br> 
🥗🥬🥕🍉🥑🍅🍇🥝🥔🍍🍊🍌🍈🥭🍎🍒🍠🍓🍑🥒🍋🍆🌽🫑🍏🍐🥦🌶

<br> 

1. Your name 
2. Your affinity vegetable and your "why" 
3. Your way in which others have helped you feel [**welcome**]{.alert-2} or [**supported in your learning**]{.alert-2}

*After everyone has spoken, go around **again** with:* 

4. Your way in which others have made you have made you feel [**unwelcome**]{.alert-4} or [**discouraged in your learning**]{.alert-4}?

## 

### Writing Time Again (4 minutes)

<br> <br> 

What's something you are [**better at than most people**]{.alert-2}? 

Were you ever **not** good at it? 

How did you **get** good at it? 

## 

### Back in Groups (8 mins)

<br> <br> 

1. Your name and affinity vegetable
2. Your superpower! Something you are better at than most people. 


*Once everyone has spoken, go around **again** with:*

3. How did you **get** good at your superpower?

### Syllabus Review: Calculating Final Grades

<br> <br> 

**First Row**: what's the **smallest** number of Learning Targets a student can satisfy in order to earn an **A-**? 

**Second Row**: describe, in terms of Learning Targets, Labs, and Warmups, a scenario in which a student would earn a **B+**.  

**Third Row**: which of these assignment types have "partial credit"? Which of them have a chance to try again? 

- Warmups
- Quiz problems
- Lab reports


<!-- In this activity, we'll practice using [this checklist](../../../pages/checkbox-table.qmd) to calculate final grades in several scenarios.  -->



## (If Time) Mathematical Writing

**Mathematical writing** is something we'll be doing a lot of in this course, and we're about to start with it in our upcoming warmup and lab assignment. Let's compare and contrast two examples of mathematical writing. 

> Prove that the sum of two even integers is also even. 

## 

### Solution 1

$2i + 2j = 2(i + j)$

## 

### Solution 2

::: {#prp-even}

## Sum of Even Integers is Even

Let $m$ and $n$ be any two even integers. Then, $m+n$ is also an even integer. 

:::

::: {.proof}

Let $m$ and $n$ be any two even integers. Then, there is some integer $i$ such that $m = 2i$, and similarly there is some integer $j$ such that $n = 2j$. We can then write 

$$
m + n = 2i + 2j = 2(i + j)\;.
$$

The second equality follows from the distributive law of multiplication. 
Therefore, $m+n$ can be written in the form $2k$ for the choice $k = i+j$. Therefore, $m+n$ is an integer, as was to be shown.

### Exercise

Draft a proof that the sum of two odd integers is also even. It's ok not to write out complete sentences, but use abbreviations that would help remind you which sentences to put where.
