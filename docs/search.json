Generative language models are already contributing to layoffs.\nCompanies training LLMs are stealing from authors and publishers to assemble their training data.\nLLMs systematically reproduce harmful stereotypes along axes of gender and race.\nIncreases in the amount of resources required to train LLMs are concentrating power in the hands of a small number of tech corporations.\nLLMs regularly generate responses that are humorously or dangerously wrong.\n\n\n\nLLMs Are Like Cars\nI encourage you to think of LLMs like you think about gas cars.\n\nLike cars, LLMs can be extremely helpful.

These activities will prepare you for either class (practice, discussion), or lab. We’ll have our quiz roughly every third Friday.\n\nRationale\nThe overall format of CSCI 0200 is designed to help you apply the ideas and skills of the course to progressively higher stages of Bloom’s taxonomy of cognition (Anderson and Krathwohl (2001)).\n\nAnderson, Lorin W, and David R Krathwohl. 2001. A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Complete Edition. Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.\n\n\n\nBloom’s taxonomy of cognitive skills. Image credit: University of Florida\n\n\n\n\nBefore Class: Warmups\n\nWarmups are here to help you remember and understand new material. Each day, you’ll prepare for class by watching videos, completing readings, and solving a small number of relatively short warmup problems. You’ll then submit your solutions on Gradescope. You’ll get feedback on your solutions from our graders. Your warmup solutions are expected to show effort but are not graded for correctness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarmups are due by 8:30am on the day of class. Warmups are never accepted late and there are no extensions. However, you can miss up to three warmups without any impact on your grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nClass on Mondays and Wednesdays: Questions, Activities, and Discussion\n\nBy the time you’ve completed the warmups and made it to class, I’m expecting that you have already made some effort to remember and understand the new material for that day. During class time on Mondays and Wednesdays, we’ll usually start with some time to discuss questions you might have from the day’s readings, videos, or warmups, to help build your understanding. Then, we’ll usually have time to work on problems in groups, or to further discuss topics. These activities will help you build your abilities to apply the material and use it to  analyze  more complicated problems.\n\n\nQuizzes (Every Third Friday)\n\nOn quizzes, you’ll demonstrate your ability to remember, understand, and apply key ideas and skills. We’ll have four quizzes throughout the semester. On each quiz, there will be one problem related to each of the twelve learning targets that we have introduced in the course so far. We’ll introduce 3 new learning targets in time for each quiz. So, our first quiz will have 3 problems, our second quiz will have 6 problems, our third quiz will have 9 problems, and our last quiz will have 12 problems. You should plan to attempt 2-3 problems on each quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur final exam will be similar to the final quiz, including one problem for all 12 learning targets in the course. The only difference is that you’ll have 3 hours instead of 50 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabs (Every Other Friday)\n\nIn labs, you’ll build your abilities to  analyze , evaluate, and create using the tools and topics from this class. We’ll have lab assignments in 8 weeks (skipping the weeks in which we have quizzes). You’ll start on lab assignments in groups in class on Fridays. You’ll complete the remaining problems and prepare your report, submitting the entire result as a typed PDF.\nLabs are due one week after the day we start them in class.\nYou may continue to work on your report with classmates, but your report should be written by you and reflect your own understanding of the material. A good heuristic: discussion and work at the whiteboard is great to share, but typed solutions or code should not be shared.\nLabs are assessed on a 4-point rubric. After receiving your assessment on your lab report, you may revise and resubmit your report for a higher assessment."

Solutions with minor errors that are otherwise demonstrate learning earn an S, while solutions that demonstrate important misunderstandings (or are not attempted) earn an NS.\nOnce you have earned an S on a quiz problem, you have completed the corresponding Learning Target. You never need to attempt another quiz problem corresponding to that target. So, if you earn an S on an LS2 problem on Quiz 1, you should not try an LS2 problem on Quiz 2. So, even though you are going to have a total of 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 12 = 42 problems placed in front of you on quizzes and the final exam, you only need to satisfactorily complete a total of 12 problems on the quizzes and final exam.

This report suggests that you have room to improve, but you understand the material well enough that the best use of your time is to move on.\nNeeds Revision (R): The lab exhibits some understanding of the material, but there are major issues that should be fixed before moving on.\nNot Completed (N): The lab isn’t really complete enough to demonstrate understanding of the material.\n\n\nRevising Labs\nAfter receiving feedback on your lab report, you may revise it in response to the feedback and resubmit it for a higher assessment. You can do this once for each lab report. The due date for revisions will depend on exactly when our grading time can finalize the first round of assessments, but will usually be about two weeks after you get your first round of feedback."

    "text": "Your Final Grade\nYour final grade in the course will be determined by the bundle of Learning Targets and Lab assessments you achieve by the end of the course, according to the following table. To earn the given grade, you need to meet all requirements for both Learning Targets and Labs. Here’s a version of this table with checkboxes that you can use to track your progress in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTier\nLearning Targets(out of 12)\nLabs (out of 7)\n\n\n\n\nA\nAt least 11\n\nNo Ns or Rs\nAt least 4 Es\nRemainder Ms\n\n\n\nB\nAt least 8\n\nNo Ns or Rs\nAt least 2 Es\nRemainder Ms\n\n\n\nC\nAt least 6\n\nNo Ns\nAt least 5 Ms or Es\nRemainder Rs\n\n\n\n\nI reserve the right to modify this table, but only in ways that make it easier to achieve each grade tier.\n\nPartial Completion\nWhen you completely meet both requirements for one tier and completely meet one requirement for a higher tier, you earn the “-” version of the next higher tier grade. For example, you may completely meet the requirements of a B on Learning Targets and completely meet the requirements of an A on Labs. In this case, you earn a minus grade for the higher tier: an A-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you fully meet the requirements for the C tier and meet the requirements of the A tier for either Learning Targets or Labs (but not both), then you are considered to have partially met the requirements of the B tier. In this case, your final grade would be a B-.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of Warmups\nYou can miss at most three warmups without penalty. After the first three missing warmups, your grade will lower by 1/3 of a letter grade for every two missing warmups. For example, an A would become an A-, a B+ would become a B, a B- would become a C+, etc.\n\n\nIn more detail, the penalties are:\n\n0-3 missing warmups: -0\n4-5 missing warmups: -1/3\n6-7 missing warmups: -2/3\n8-9 missing warmups: -1\netc."

To do so, you should fill out this modified due date request form. You can count on receiving such an extension without a negotation if you:\n\nRequest the extension at least one day (24 hours) in advance of the original due date.\nWrite short but thoughtful responses to the questions posed in the form.\n\nLabs that are turned in after the due date (or possibly the extended due date) will still be accepted and assessed. However, these late lab reports will count as your second submission, and the assessment you receive on that lab report will be final.\n\n\nQuizzes\nYou can reschedule quizzes under the following circumstances.\n\nYou have an emergency related to your health, mental health, or wellbeing, or the health, mental health, or wellbeing of your loved ones. No documentation is needed – just let me know.\nYou are traveling for a major athletic event. In this case, you must notify me at least two weeks in advance.

    "section": "About ChatGPT",
    "text": "About ChatGPT\n\nWhat Is It?\nChatGPT is an example of a large language model (LLM). LLMs aim to produce helpful, human-like text with a combination of two major mechanisms:\n\nLLMs use next-token prediction to predict the next entries in a sequence of text by using the previous entries. This enables them to mimic human-produced text. So, if you saw the sequence “I love Math Foundations of _____”, you might guess that the next word might be “Computing” and that it’s probably not “Pineapples.”\nLLMs are trained using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to produce sentences that are not just realistic but also helpful, nonoffensive, or accurate. They do this using a multistage training process that involves humans rating the quality of candidate texts.\n\nChatGPT and similar LLMs are shaping many conversations in education at Middlebury and beyond.\nWhile LLMs may have many benefits, they are also the subject of routine deception by powerful, motivated actors. They are powered by massive quantities of low-paying, traumatizing labor. LLMs and automation more generally are furthering labor instability, contributing to reduced wages, and are concentrating the power of a small number of large tech companies.\n\n\nIn This Class\n\nWork that you submit in this class must demonstrate your learning and understanding. Copy/paste from LLMs like ChatGPT does not do this, and is consequently a violation of academic integrity.\nYou are discouraged from using ChatGPT in any way on warmups. The reason is that warmups help you prepare for the quizzes; if you don’t practice on the warmups, you’ll do worse and get a lower grade.\nQuizzes are in-class assessments on which electronics are prohibited. This implies that ChatGPT is prohibited on quizzes.\nYou are free to consult ChatGPT (or other LLMs) when studying and when completing lab reports. If you do, you must treat ChatGPT as an unverified source. This means:\n\nYou must cite your source.\nYou must describe the contribution of the source to your submitted writeup.\nYou may paraphrase but may not quote ChatGPT.\nYou must describe what steps you have taken to check that your learning involving ChatGPT is indeed correct.\n\nYou are always personally responsible for the accuracy, quality, and integrity of your work."

We’ll both get more out of this encounter if we understand what mathematical experiences you’re bringing with you.\n© Phil Chodrow, 2023"

Are you nervous? Excited? What have you heard from your friends? What are you expecting?\nIn the spirit of sharing, here’s my math autobiography."

If you like using word processors, the simplest way to achieve this is to Print as PDF.\nLength: Your math autobiography should show reflection on your experiences. If you’re only writing few paragraphs, there’s more for you to think about. More than a (single-spaced) page probably isn’t necessary. If you find yourself spending more than 90 minutes on this assignment, wrap up your current sentence and submit your autobiography.\nGrading: This is our first warmup assignment. Per the syllabus, warmup assignments are graded Complete or Incomplete/Missing. For Complete, you just need to spend some careful time thinking and writing. Typos, grammar mistakes, etc. are not an issue on this assignment.\nSubmission: Please submit your math autobiography on Canvas."

This table doesn’t take into account penalties for missing warmups.\nInstructions:\n\nCheck off Learning Targets as you go, starting from the bottom. For example, once you’ve checked off 6 learning targets you have filled the “C” row, and once you’ve checked off 8 learning targets you have filled the “B” row.\nCheck off Labs as you get receive feedback. When you receive an assessmment on a lab, you can check off that lab up to once in each grade tier. For example, if you receive an M, you can check off one box for “M or E” in each of Tiers A, B, and C. If you receive an E, you can check off one box for E in Tiers A and B, and one box for M or E in Tier C. R’s can only be used to check off boxes in the second row of Tier C.\n\nOnce all boxes in a row are checked, you have earned that grade in the course, provided that you have missed no more than 3 warmup activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTier\nLearning Targets\nLabs\n\n\n\n\nA\n▢ ▢ ▢\nE: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ M or E: ▢ ▢ ▢\n\n\nB\n▢ ▢\nE: ▢ ▢ M or E: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\n\nC\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nM or E: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢  R, M, or E: ▢ ▢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s an example for a student who completed 9 learning targets, earned “Exemplary” on five labs, and earned “Meets Expectations” on three labs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTier\nLearning Targets\nLabs\n\n\n\n\nA\n▢ ▢ ☑\nE: ☑ ☑ ☑ ☑ M or E: ☑ ☑ ☑\n\n\nB\n☑ ☑\nE: ☑ ☑ M or E: ☑ ☑ ☑ ☑ ☑\n\n\nC\n☑ ☑ ☑ ☑ ☑ ☑\nM or E: ☑ ☑ ☑ ☑ ☑  R, M, or E: ☑ ☑\n\n\n\nThis student fully meets the requirements of a B and partially meets the requirements of an A, and therefore earns an A- (provided they have missed no more than 3 warmups).\n\n\n  © Phil Chodrow, 2023"

    "text": "Why Collaborate?\nMost scientists and engineers don’t work on their own; they work with colleagues and students while doing and publishing research. Increasingly, open problems in science and engineering require multiple skill sets and areas of expertise. Because of this, the need to collaborate will only increase in the future. This is why several of CS@Midd’s learning goals are explicitly focused on communication and collaboration. We want our students to have strong professional and communication skills, to be able to function well as part of a team, and to be able to work and communicate with diverse groups of people."

    "section": "Collaborating on Homework and Other Individually-Assessed Assignments",
    "text": "Collaborating on Homework and Other Individually-Assessed Assignments\n\n(COLLABORATION IS A LIFE SKILL) Understand that working with others and asking for assistance are not signs of weakness or deficiency; rather, they are essential life skills important for making progress in any discipline, including computer science. Our department wants you to develop these skills. If you’re too shy to come to my office hours or to join a group of people working on their homework, ask a friend to come with you.\n(COLLABORATIONS BENEFIT FROM DIVERSITY) Open yourself up to working with people whom you don’t know (yet). You might find someone you work really well with and who doesn’t think exactly like you do. A wide range of experiecnes and backgrounds is beneficial in problem solving, although it may be helpful to find folks who can work on assignments during the same time of day and at roughly the same pace. If you’re having trouble finding people to work with, I can help!\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE INCLUSIVE) Believe that everyone has something meaningful to contribute (you included), and that you have something to learn from each person. This can be a difficult state of mind to achieve, but critical for healthy, effective collaboration. Here are some practical consequences:\n\nIn any group setting, listen carefully for everyone’s contributions. Don’t dismiss or ignore what someone says, and don’t move on until you’ve considered it carefully. If what is said doesn’t make sense to you, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s incorrect–the person might just have a way of approaching the problem that is different and not yet clear to you. Furthermore, even ideas that ultimately turn out to be incomplete or incorrect are often still useful building blocks towards a successful approach.\nFind ways to verbally validate the ideas of others. For example: “One really neat feature of Zenith’s approach to part (b) is that it also works with a small modification for part (c).”\nIf someone in the group hasn’t spoken for a while, ask for their ideas or opinions. Conversely, if you find yourself talking a lot, take a step back and allow someone else to contribute to the discussion.\n\n(COLLABORATIONS REQUIRE PREPARATION) Don’t seek help from others on a probem before you’ve had time to think about it yourself, try at least one approach, and formulate the obstacle as clearly as you can. But at the same time, if you find yourself frustrated with a problem and you’re not making progress, don’t wait too long before you look for help from your classmates, your tutors, or me.\n(COLLABORATIONS GENERATE DEEPER UNDERSTANDING) Don’t be satisfied with only producing the correct final result; use your collaboration to push each other to understand:\n\nWhy does this approach work?\nWhat alternative approaches would also have worked?\nWhat are some of the merits and drawbacks of these different approaches?\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE EMPOWERING) Good collaborations empower people towards further growth.\n\nWhen you’re working on a problem with others and you find a path before everyone else, avoid ruining the experience of discovery for others. Conversely, if you haven’t figured out something yet and want to enjoy the discovery for yourself, don’t let someone else ruin your joy.\nIf someone asks you for help, don’t just tell them the answer or start showing them a solution method. Listen carefully to their question. Ask for more information if they aren’t being specific enough. If they say “I don’t know where to start,” ask them to tell you about their understanding of what the question is asking and which parts of it seem most puzzling. Ask guiding questions to help them discover ideas for themselves. In these situations, you have the opportunity to learn how to help others learn – this is an invaluable life skill.\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ACKNOWLEDGE CONTRIBUTORS) Whenever you’ve received help on a homework assignment from a classmate, a friend, a tutor, or me, acknowledge the support and briefly describe how it helped you in your assignment.\n\nThe reason I ask you to acknowledge tutors and myself is actually different from the reason I ask you to acknowledge classmates and friends. For classmates and friends, it’s about cultivating transparency and integrity. The primary reason I want you to acknowledge tutors and myself is that the exercise of explicitly remembering and reflecting on your learning journey is part of metacognition, a valuable set of practices that will help you succeed in this class, in college, and in your long-term career."

When, where, and how often will you meet? How can you reach each other in case of an emergency?\n(COLLABORATION IS NOT DIVISION OF LABOR) Collaboration is not the same as splitting up a problem into pieces and then slapping the completed pieces together.\n\nIdentify the parts of the problem that need to be completed together and the parts that can be completed individually.\nWork toward a final product that everyone is happy with and that represents the contributions of everyone on the group.\nDon’t just divide up the work based on who might have the most experience or skill with each part of the problem. Let those who want to develop their skills also have a chance to work on pieces that are unfamiliar to them\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE EQUITABLE) Aim for each person to contribute a fair and equitable amount of effort and/or time to the group’s deliverables.\n(COLLABORATIONS RESOLVE CONFLICT QUICKLY) Resolve any misunderstands between the team members quickly. Don’t let those misunderstandings fester into distrust, resentment, or anger. Don’t be afraid to ask your professor for help in resolving interpersonal conflict in your team. While this can feel uncomfortable, often these kinds of situations are important opportunities for everyone to learn more about how to coexist as collaborative, whole humans."

When you turn in such an assignment, you implicitly represent that work as work that you are able to complete yourself under the stated conditions (which may include getting help or working with others). If you cannot complete some work under the stated collaboration conditions, it is dishonest to turn in that work.\nWhen working individually, it is your responsibility to uphold the Code’s standards of integrity and academic honesty. When working in a group, it is additionally your responsibility to ensure that your group as a whole upholds these standards.\nIf you have a question about whether some form of collaboration is permitted, just ask!\n\nWhat Happens if I Observe an Honor Violation?\n\nWe all fail to uphold our highest moral aspirations at times. If you show lack of integrity or academic honesty, that doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. It means that you’re under pressure and chose the course of action that looked like the most workable one to you at the time.\nThat said, if you show lack of integrity or academic honesty, that’s an indicator that you have an opportunity for some very important growth.\nIt is part of my job to help you achieve that growth. I take this part of my job very seriously. In order to help you on your journey, I will connect both of us with the Middlebury Community Standards Office. Office leadership will help us all find a path that helps you grow toward integrity and honesty.\nThis is an awkward and uncomfortable process for everyone involved. You don’t want this."
