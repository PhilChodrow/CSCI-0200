    "text": "What Makes a Good Project?\n\nBig Picture\nThere’s a lot more detail on this topic below, but there are two simple questions that you should ask yourselves when envisioning your project:\n\nWill I learn something by completing this project?  Will I be proud of this project once it’s done?\n\nIf the answer to both questions is “yes,” then your overall project idea is likely good. Feel free to approach me early if you want to talk over whether your project idea is suitable for the course.\n\n\nBoring Projects\nThere is a kind of machine learning project that I feel is very boring and doesn’t really teach all that much. I’ll call these “Kaggle-style” projects. A “Kaggle-style” project is a project that starts with a convenient, clean data set and ends with a test score.  KS projects don’t clean or explore the data; don’t implement new algorithms; and don’t think carefully about why one algorithm might be better than another for the data in question. Instead, they simply try a bunch of things and assess them with a validation or test score.  I will probably not be impressed with a Kaggle-style project, partly because these kinds of projects really only address the “Navigation” learning objective.The website Kaggle is famous for hosting machine learning competitions in which the goal is to train a model that achieves the best prediction score on test data.I am being a little unfair; some Kaggle submissions are of exceptionally high quality.\nIt’s fine (indeed, encouraged!) for you to find some data that interests you and apply machine learning methods to it in order to make predictions or understand the structure of the data. To deepen your project beyond “Kaggle style,” you can incorporate some or all of the following:\n\nWork with data that is messy and needs significant processing before it can be used for ML tasks.\nDesign a custom vectorization scheme (i.e. way of representing each data points as a vector), or experiment with several pre-implemented schemes.\nConstruct multiple visualizations of your data that highlight patterns you wish to model or questions that you wish to explore.\nConduct a careful audit of your model to understand whether it performs better in some situations than others.\n\n\n\nCritical Discussion\nOne thing that should be incorporated into both your proposal and your project writeup is a critical discussion of incentives and impacts in your model.\nIncorporate a critical discussion of incentives and impacts in your work.\n\nIf someone were paying you to develop this model, who would be paying and why? Why might someone want this model to be built? Are you comfortable with that?\nWho are the users of your work? Who could be affected by your work? Are these populations the same?\nAre there risks of substantial bias or harm associated with the work you produce?"

    "text": "Ideas\nHere are some suggestions for choosing project directions. It’s fine for your project to be something entirely different—indeed, I encourage it! The primary benefit of projects that I come up with is that they are more likely to “work.” The primary drawback is that they may not be what you’re interested in! Even projects that don’t fully meet their stated objectives can still be successful experiences that demonstrate learning for the course.\n\nTheory and Implementation\nIf you enjoy thinking about math and how to translate math into performant numerical code, then you may wish to consider implementing a machine learning algorithm that we haven’t implemented in blog posts. There are many candidates, and it can be partially up to you to decide. Since the project is bigger than a blog post…\n\n…Your implementation should likely be of a more complex algorithm than ones we implemented in blog posts already. Alternatively, you could implement several related algorithms.\n…You will likely need to perform more complicated experiments in order to demonstrate the performance of your implementation.\n\nBecause these projects involve theoretical content that we haven’t covered in class, it is a good idea to talk with me before committing to one of them.\n\nSupport Vector Machine\nSupport vector machines (SVMs) were among the state-of-the-art binary classifiers before the rise of deep neural networks. Support vector machines are convex linear classifiers like logistic regression, but have some special mathematical properties that enable them to make much faster predictions on new data by leveraging sparsity. A good SVM project would likely involve most or all of the following:\n\nImplementing SVM using a version of stochastic gradient descent called PEGASOS (Fig. 2 in Shalev-Shwartz, Singer, and Srebro (2007)).\nImplementing kernel SVM, which enables nonlinear decision boundaries, using a quadratic solver.\nTesting your results on several real and synthetic data sets for:\n\nRuntime of training.\nRuntime of prediction.\nAccuracy of prediction.\n\n\n\n\nFaster Gradient Descent\nGradient descent and its relatives apply to a wide range of machine learning algorithms. Gradient descent comes in many flavors:\n\nStochastic\nMomentum\nAccelerated\nPrimal-dual methods\nModified gradient methods for nonconvex problems\nNewton methods\n\netc. etc. One good project could be to implement several of these methods for one or more ML algorithms, comparing the runtime of the training step on a variety of data sets.\n\n\nOther\nI can throw you lots of other theoretical/implementation problems if you’re interested—come chat and we can discuss."

Increasingly, open problems in science and engineering require multiple skill sets and areas of expertise. Because of this, the need to collaborate will only increase in the future. This is why several of CS@Midd’s learning goals are explicitly focused on communication and collaboration. We want our students to have strong professional and communication skills, to be able to function well as part of a team, and to be able to work and communicate with diverse groups of people."

    "section": "Collaborating on Homework and Other Individually-Assessed Assignments",
    "text": "Collaborating on Homework and Other Individually-Assessed Assignments\n\n(COLLABORATION IS A LIFE SKILL) Understand that working with others and asking for assistance are not signs of weakness or deficiency; rather, they are essential life skills important for making progress in any discipline, including computer science. Our department wants you to develop these skills. If you’re too shy to come to my office hours or to join a group of people working on their homework, ask a friend to come with you.\n(COLLABORATIONS BENEFIT FROM DIVERSITY) Open yourself up to working with people whom you don’t know (yet). You might find someone you work really well with and who doesn’t think exactly like you do. A wide range of experiecnes and backgrounds is beneficial in problem solving, although it may be helpful to find folks who can work on assignments during the same time of day and at roughly the same pace. If you’re having trouble finding people to work with, I can help!\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE INCLUSIVE) Believe that everyone has something meaningful to contribute (you included), and that you have something to learn from each person. This can be a difficult state of mind to achieve, but critical for healthy, effective collaboration. Here are some practical consequences:\n\nIn any group setting, listen carefully for everyone’s contributions. Don’t dismiss or ignore what someone says, and don’t move on until you’ve considered it carefully. If what is said doesn’t make sense to you, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s incorrect–the person might just have a way of approaching the problem that is different and not yet clear to you. Furthermore, even ideas that ultimately turn out to be incomplete or incorrect are often still useful building blocks towards a successful approach.\nFind ways to verbally validate the ideas of others. For example: “One really neat feature of Zenith’s approach to part (b) is that it also works with a small modification for part (c).”\nIf someone in the group hasn’t spoken for a while, ask for their ideas or opinions. Conversely, if you find yourself talking a lot, take a step back and allow someone else to contribute to the discussion.\n\n(COLLABORATIONS REQUIRE PREPARATION) Don’t seek help from others on a probem before you’ve had time to think about it yourself, try at least one approach, and formulate the obstacle as clearly as you can. But at the same time, if you find yourself frustrated with a problem and you’re not making progress, don’t wait too long before you look for help from your classmates, your tutors, or me.\n(COLLABORATIONS GENERATE DEEPER UNDERSTANDING) Don’t be satisfied with only producing the correct final result; use your collaboration to push each other to understand:\n\nWhy does this approach work?\nWhat alternative approaches would also have worked?\nWhat are some of the merits and drawbacks of these different approaches?\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE EMPOWERING) Good collaborations empower people towards further growth.\n\nWhen you’re working on a problem with others and you find a path before everyone else, avoid ruining the experience of discovery for others. Conversely, if you haven’t figured out something yet and want to enjoy the discovery for yourself, don’t let someone else ruin your joy.\nIf someone asks you for help, don’t just tell them the answer or start showing them a solution method. Listen carefully to their question. Ask for more information if they aren’t being specific enough. If they say “I don’t know where to start,” ask them to tell you about their understanding of what the question is asking and which parts of it seem most puzzling. Ask guiding questions to help them discover ideas for themselves. In these situations, you have the opportunity to learn how to help others learn – this is an invaluable life skill.\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ACKNOWLEDGE CONTRIBUTORS) Whenever you’ve received help on a homework assignment from a classmate, a friend, a tutor, or me, acknowledge the support and briefly describe how it helped you in your assignment.\n\nThe reason I ask you to acknowledge tutors and myself is actually different from the reason I ask you to acknowledge classmates and friends. For classmates and friends, it’s about cultivating transparency and integrity. The primary reason I want you to acknowledge tutors and myself is that the exercise of explicitly remembering and reflecting on your learning journey is part of metacognition, a valuable set of practices that will help you succeed in this class, in college, and in your long-term career."

When, where, and how often will you meet? How can you reach each other in case of an emergency?\n(COLLABORATION IS NOT DIVISION OF LABOR) Collaboration is not the same as splitting up a problem into pieces and then slapping the completed pieces together.\n\nIdentify the parts of the problem that need to be completed together and the parts that can be completed individually.\nWork toward a final product that everyone is happy with and that represents the contributions of everyone on the group.\nDon’t just divide up the work based on who might have the most experience or skill with each part of the problem. Let those who want to develop their skills also have a chance to work on pieces that are unfamiliar to them\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE EQUITABLE) Aim for each person to contribute a fair and equitable amount of effort and/or time to the group’s deliverables.\n(COLLABORATIONS RESOLVE CONFLICT QUICKLY) Resolve any misunderstands between the team members quickly. Don’t let those misunderstandings fester into distrust, resentment, or anger. Don’t be afraid to ask your professor for help in resolving interpersonal conflict in your team. While this can feel uncomfortable, often these kinds of situations are important opportunities for everyone to learn more about how to coexist as collaborative, whole humans."

When you turn in such an assignment, you implicitly represent that work as work that you are able to complete yourself under the stated conditions (which may include getting help or working with others). If you cannot complete some work under the stated collaboration conditions, it is dishonest to turn in that work.\nWhen working individually, it is your responsibility to uphold the Code’s standards of integrity and academic honesty. When working in a group, it is additionally your responsibility to ensure that your group as a whole upholds these standards.\nIf you have a question about whether some form of collaboration is permitted, just ask!\n\nWhat Happens if I Observe an Honor Violation?\n\nWe all fail to uphold our highest moral aspirations at times. If you show lack of integrity or academic honesty, that doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. It means that you’re under pressure and chose the course of action that looked like the most workable one to you at the time.\nThat said, if you show lack of integrity or academic honesty, that’s an indicator that you have an opportunity for some very important growth.\nIt is part of my job to help you achieve that growth. I take this part of my job very seriously. In order to help you on your journey, I will connect both of us with the Middlebury Community Standards Office. Office leadership will help us all find a path that helps you grow toward integrity and honesty.\nThis is an awkward and uncomfortable process for everyone involved. You don’t want this."

I broadly agree with Jesse Stommel when he writes:\n\nAgency, dialogue, self-actualization, and social justice are not possible in a hierarchical system that pits teachers against students and encourages competition by ranking students against one another. Grades (and institutional rankings) are currency for a capitalist system that reduces teaching and learning to a mere transaction. Grading is a massive co-ordinated effort to take humans out of the educational process.\n\nI’d prefer to just not give you grades at all.

Blog posts usually involve: written explanation of some relevant theory; implementation one or more algorithms according to written specifications; performing experiments to test the performance of the implementations; and communicating findings in a professional way. Some blog posts will be more like short essays than problem sets or programming assignments. Your blog posts will be hosted on your own public website (which you will create). This website will serve as your portfolio for the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject\n\n\n\nYour project is a large-scale undertaking that you will design and complete, usually in a group of 2 or 3, over the course of the semester. Your project should usually involve some combination of data collection, implementation, research of related work, experimentation, deployment, or theory work (but not necessarily all components). Projects are expected to demonstrate deep engagement with both the course content and the problem selected.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Reflections\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the course, you’ll write a process reflection describing your aspirations for the course—what you want to learn and achieve, and how you’d like to be assessed against your goals. We’ll have a second process reflection mid-way through the course that will allow you to reflect on your progress toward your objectives and consider changing direction if needed. At the end of the course, you’ll write a summary reflection on your learning, accomplishment, and engagement with the class. This is also the place where you’ll propose your final letter grade.   I’ll usually give you written feedback on your process reflections. We’ll also meet at the end of the course to discuss your final reflection and agree on your letter grade for the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther…?\n\n\n\nYou may have some topic or idea that especially interests you and which you want to explore. If you’d like to work on this topic and use it to demonstrate your learning in the course, you can propose it to me. I may have suggestions or requested modifications before I agree to count the work in your course portfolio."

I encourage you to wear masks during help sessions and at all other times when you are inside 75 Shannon Street.\nIf you arrive in class without a mask, I will offer you one.

First, there’s a lot of solution code for machine learning tasks in Python online. Second, I’m literally asking you all to post your assignments publicly online. So, there are lots of opportunities to turn in assignments without actually doing the learning that those assignments are designed to offer you.\nI assume that both of us want you to learn some cool stuff. Cheating stops you from doing that, and ultimately wastes both your time and mine. I won’t be vigorously hunting for academic integrity violations, but I may ask you to discuss code or theory with me in class or in our meetings. If I notice you struggling to explain code that you submitted for feedback, I may have questions.\nTrust me. Neither of us want this."
