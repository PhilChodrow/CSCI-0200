[You can learn more about the theory of computation in CSCI 0301, about proving correctness and performance of algorithms in CSCI 0302 and 0401, and about the role of math in applications in electives like CSCI 0422, 0451, and 0452.]{.aside}

Welcome to CSCI 0200: Math Foundations of Computing! In this course, we'll study **how to think computationally using mathematics**. There are three primary roles for mathematics in modern computation: 

1. The mathematical **theory of computation** describes the capabilities and limits of computers. 
    - Example question: Can a computer scan an algorithm to determine whether that algorithm terminates with the correct result? 
2. Mathematics is used to prove guarantees about the correctness and performance of **algorithms**. 
    - Example questions: Does the MergeSort algorithm correctly sort a list *all the time*? Does it work in $O(n \log n)$ time? *How do you know*? 
3. Mathematics is used in a wide range of **computational applications**, including graphics, image processing, simulation, and machine learning.

# Class Format

## Flipped Class

CSCI 0200 is a *flipped classroom*. This means that our scheduled class periods will primarily be time for you to **actively practice and get feedback.** Your first introduction to new material will be through assigned readings, videos, and warmup problems. 

- On **Mondays** and **Wednesdays**, you will watch videos, complete readings, and do warmup problems *before class*. In class, we'll discuss some of your questions from the warmups and work together on practice problems. 
- On **Fridays**, you will watch videos, complete readings, and do warmup problems *before class*. During class, you'll work in groups on Lab assignments. You'll complete the Lab assignments outside of class and turn them in. 

## Course Activities

The overall format of CSCI 0200 is designed to help you apply the ideas and skills of the course to progressively higher stages of *Bloom's taxonomy of cognition*.

### Before Class: Warmups

[![](assets/img/figs/blooms-taxonomy-warmups.png)]{.aside}

Warmups are here to help you <span style="color:#7030a0">**remember**</span> and <span style="color:#0070c0">**understand**</span> new material. Each day, you'll prepare for class by watching videos, completing readings, and solving a small number of relatively short warmup problems. You'll then submit your solutions on Gradescope. You'll get feedback on your solutions from our graders. Your warmup solutions are expected to show effort but are not graded for correctness. 

Warmups are due by 8:30am on the day of class. Warmups are never accepted late and there are no extensions. However, [you can miss up to three warmups](#assessment-of-warmups) without any impact on your grade. 

### Class on Mondays and Wednesdays: Questions, Activities, and Discussion

[![](assets/img/figs/blooms-taxonomy-in-class.png)]{.aside}

By the time you've completed the warmups and made it to class, I'm expecting that you have already made some effort to <span style="color:#7030a0">**remember**</span> and <span style="color:#0070c0">**understand**</span> the new material for that day. During class time on Mondays and Wednesdays, we'll usually start with some time to discuss questions you might have from the day's readings, videos, or warmups, to help build your  <span style="color:#0070c0">**understanding**</span>. Then, we'll usually have time to work on problems in groups, or to further discuss topics. These activities will help you build your abilities to <span style="color:#0070c0">**understand**</span> and <span style="color:#00b050">**apply**</span> the material. 

### Quizzes

[![](assets/img/figs/blooms-taxonomy-quizzes.png)]{.aside}

On quizzes, you'll demonstrate your ability to <span style="color:#7030a0">**remember**</span>, <span style="color:#0070c0">**understand**</span>, and <span style="color:#00b050">**apply**</span> key ideas and skills. We'll have four quizzes throughout the semester. On each quiz, there will be one question related to each of [the twelve learning targets](#learning-targets) that we have introduced in the course so far. So, our first quiz will have three questions, our second quiz will have 6 questions, our third quiz will have 9 questions, and our last quiz will have twelve. You should plan to attempt 2-3 problems on each quiz. 
 
Once you have earned *Satisfactory* on a learning target, **you do not need to attempt that target again.** You're done with that one! On the next quiz, you should attempt a different learning target.

Our final exam will include one question for every learning target in the course, similarly to the last. This gives you a chance to earn *Satisfactory* on learning targets for anything you might not yet have gotten by the final quiz.    


### Labs

[![](assets/img/figs/blooms-taxonomy-labs.png)]{.aside}

In labs, you'll build your abilities to <span style="color:#ffd54f"> **analyze** </span>, <span style="color:#ff9933">**evaluate**</span>, and <span style="color:#ff2f2f">**create**</span> using the tools and topics from this class. 
We'll have lab assignments in 8 weeks (skipping the weeks in which we have quizzes). 
You'll start on lab assignments in groups in class on Fridays. You'll complete the remaining problems and prepare your report, submitting the entire result as a typed PDF.  


You may continue to work on your report with classmates, but your report should be written by you and reflect your own understanding of the material. 
A good heuristic: **discussion** and **work at the whiteboard** is great to share, but typed solutions or code should not be shared.   

Labs are graded on a [4-point rubric](#labs). After receiving your grade on your lab report, you may revise and resubmit your report for a higher grade.  



# Assessment and Grades

## Warmups

**Warmups are not graded for correctness**. The two grades you can receive are "**Complete**" or "**Incomplete/Missing**." A grade of **Complete** means that you made good effort on the problems and that your attempt demonstrates at least partial understanding of the reading and videos. Most days, 1.5-2 hours of prep time will usually be sufficient for you to complete the readings, videos, and warmups. 

## Quizzes

Quiz problems are assessed as **Satisfactory (S)** or **Incomplete/Not Yet Satisfactory (NS)**. To earn an **S** on a quiz problem, you must complete the entire problem correctly, modulo [minor errors](pages/minor-errors.qmd) unrelated to the learning goals of the course (like arithmetic typos). 

Once you have earned an **S** on a quiz problem, you have completed the corresponding Learning Target. You never need to attempt another quiz problem corresponding to that target. So, if you successfully complete an **LS2** problem on Quiz 1, you should *not* try an **LS2** problem on Quiz 2. 


### Learning Targets {#learning-targets}

[Targets **LS1-3** are introduced on Quiz 1. Targets **PF1**, **PF2**, and **FR1** are introduced on Quiz 2. Targets **CR1-3** are introduced on Quiz 3. Targets **G1**, **P1**, and **P2** are introduced on Quiz 4.]{.aside}

**Logic and Sets **

- **LS1**: I can simplify and evaluate logical expressions that include quantifiers and boolean operations. 
- **LS2**: I can represent sets in set-builder notation; determine whether an object is an element of a set; and prove that one set is equal to or a subset of another. 
- **LS3**: I can perform operations on sets (intersection, union, complement, difference, Cartesian product) and determine the cardinality of a set. 

**Proofs **

- **PF1**: I can use proof-by-contradiction to prove mathematical statements. 
- **PF2**: I can choose between weak and strong induction and write correct inductive proofs that include both a base case and an inductive step. 

**Functions and Relations**

- **FR1**: I can determine whether or not a given relation is an equivalence relation. 

**Counting and Recursion**

- **CR1**: I can use the principles of addition, multiplication, and inclusion-exclusion to solve counting problems. 
- **CR2**: I can use permutations and combinations to count the number of candidate solutions to a given problem. 
- **CR3**: I can prove that a recurrence relation describes a simple algorithm's runtime and use this relation to determine the big-oh asymptotic runtime. 

**Graphs**

- **G1**: I can write correct proofs of simple mathematical propositions about the structure of graphs. 

**Probability**

- **P1**: I can evaluate marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities of events on discrete sample spaces. 
- **P2**: I can evaluate expectations and conditional expectations of random variables on discrete sample spaces. 




## Labs

Labs are graded on a 4-part rubric similar to the EMRF rubric of [Stutzman and Race](http://miss-serwy.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/1/6/12161802/emrf_rubric_1.pdf):[This particular scale is very close to the scale [used by Peter-Michael Osera](https://osera.cs.grinnell.edu/csc208/syllabus/#projects) at Grinnel.]{.aside} 

**Excellent** (**E**): 

- The lab includes a complete contributions statement describing the contributions of any collaborators, as well as external sources such as websites or ChatGPT. 
- The lab exhibits complete understanding of the material. 
- The lab has at worst, a few minor design errors or surface-level writing issues. 
- All coding experiments run and produce correct outputs.  

**Meets Expectations** (**M**):

- The lab exhibits complete understanding of the material. 
- The lab includes a complete contributions statement describing the contributions of any collaborators, as well as external sources such as websites or ChatGPT. 
- The lab has some minor errors of correctness, design, or writing. Fixing these errors would demonstrate improved understanding of the material. 
- All coding experiments run and produce outputs which are close to expected. 

**Needs Revision** (**R**): 

- The lab exhibits one or more significant misunderstandings of the material, or many minor errors. 
- Coding experiments do not run or produce substantially incorrect output. 
- The contributions statement is partial or missing. 

**Not Completed** (**N**): 

- Not completed to a degree sufficient to demonstrate understanding of the material. 

## Your Final Grade

+-----+---------------------------------+-----------------------+
|Tier | Learning Targets<br>(Out of 12) | Labs (out of 8)       |
+:====+=================================+=======================+
|**A**|   At least 11                   | - No **N**s or **R**s |
|     |                                 | - At least 4 **E**s   |
|     |                                 | - Remainder **M**s    |
+-----+---------------------------------+-----------------------+
|**B**|   At least 8                    | - No **N**s or **R**s |
|     |                                 | - At least 2 **E**s   |
|     |                                 | - Remainder **M**s    |
+-----+---------------------------------+-----------------------+
|**C**|   At least 6                    | - No **N**s           |
|     |                                 | - At least 6 **M**s   |
|     |                                 | - Remainder **R**s    |
+-----+---------------------------------+-----------------------+

### Calculating Your Grade

You can use the table below to estimate where you stand in the class based on the assignments you've submitted and the feedback you've received. [This table doesn't take into account [penalties for missing warmups](#assessment-of-warmups).]{.aside}

**Instructions**: 

- Check off **Learning Targets** as you go, starting from the bottom. For example, once you've checked off 6 learning targets you have filled the "C" row, and once you've checked off 8 learning targets you have filled the "B" row. 
- Check off **Labs** as you get receive feedback. When you receive an assessmment on a lab, you can check off that lab **up to once in each grade tier**. For example, if you receive an **S**, you can check off one box for "S or E" in each of Tiers A, B, and C. If you receive an **E**, you can check off one box for **E** in Tiers A and B, and one box for **S or E** in Tier C. **R**'s can only be used to check off boxes in the second row of Tier C. 

Once *all* boxes in a row are checked, you have earned that grade in the course, *provided* that you have missed no more than 3 warmup activities.

This student fully meets the requirements of a **B** and partially meets the requirements of an **A**, and therefore earns an **A-** (provided they have missed no more than 3 warmups). 

:::

#### Plus/minus grades

You earn a +/- modifier on a grade by fully meeting the requirements for one tier and partially meeting the requirements for the next tier. For example, you may completely meet the requirements of a **B** on Learning Targets and completely meet the requirements of an **A** on labs. In this case, you earn a minus grade for the higher tier: i.e. an A- if you are between a B and an A. 

::: {.callout-tip}

If you fully meet the requirements for the **C** tier and meet the requirements of the **A** tier for either Learning Targets or Labs (but not both), then you are considered to have partially met the requirements of the **B** tier. In this case, your grade would be a **B-**. 

:::

#### Assessment of Warmups

You can miss **at most three** warmups without penalty. After the first three missing warmups, your grade will lower by **1/3 of a letter grade for every two missing warmups**. For example, an **A** would become an **A-**, a **B-** would become a **C+**, etc. 

::: {.aside}

In more detail, the penalties are: 

- 0-3 missing warmups: -0
- 4-5 missing warmups: -1/3
- 6-7 missing warmups: -2/3
- 7-9 missing warmups: -1 
- etc.

# Collaboration and Academic Integrity

The guiding principle of Middlebury's Honor Code is that work you represent as your own must reflect **your** learning and understanding. Submission of work that does not reflect your learning and understanding may lead to grade penalties or Honors proceedings. 

## Collaborating with Integrity

Collaboration is welcome in some settings in this course. In all instances of collaboration, you should acknowledge your collaboration partner(s) and describe their contributions as part of your assignment submission. 

- **Warmups**: collaboration is *discouraged* because I think warmups are useful as practice for the quizzes. However, you're welcome to collaborate if you choose. You should acknowledge your collaboration partner in your submission. 
- **Labs**: collaboration is *encouraged* (and partially mandatory). You'll start labs in collaboration groups. You're free to complete the assignment in your groups, or to complete the assignment on your own. All students should turn in an individual submission that reflects their own understanding and which acknowledges the contributions of their collaboration partners. 
- **Quizzes**: collaboration is *prohibited*. 
- **In-class activities**: collaboration is *encouraged* (and sometimes mandatory). 
- **General study**: collaboration is *encouraged*! 


## About ChatGPT

### What Is It?

ChatGPT is an example of a *large language model* (LLM). LLMs aim to produce helpful, human-like text with a combination of two major mechanisms: 

- LLMs use *next-token prediction* to predict the next entries in a sequence of text by using the previous entries. This enables them to mimic human-produced text. So, if you saw the sequence "*I love Math Foundations of _____*", you might guess that the next word might be "*Computing*" and that it's probably not "*Pineapples*."
- LLMs are trained using *reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)* to produce sentences that are not just realistic but also *helpful*, *nonoffensive*, or *accurate*. They do this using a multistage training process that involves humans rating the quality of candidate texts. 

ChatGPT and similar LLMs are shaping many conversations in education [at Middlebury](https://www.middleburycampus.com/article/2023/03/middlebury-meets-chatgpt) and [beyond](https://www.chronicle.com/article/im-a-student-you-have-no-idea-how-much-were-using-chatgpt).

While LLMs may have many benefits, they are also the subject of [routine]((https://analyticsindiamag.com/did-google-bard-really-learn-bengali-on-its-own/)) [deception](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4441311) by powerful, motivated actors. They are powered by [massive quantities](https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots) of [low-paying, traumatizing labor](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-openai-content-abusive-sexually-explicit-harassment-kenya-workers-on-human-workers-cf191483). LLMs and automation more generally are [furthering labor instability](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-job-losses-artificial-intelligence-challenger-report/), [contributing to reduced wages](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/06/18/artificial-intelligence-has-caused--50-to-70-decrease-in-wages-creating-income-inequality-and-threatening-millions-of-jobs/?sh=6bc1e5c41009), and are [concentrating the power](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/technology/ai-computer-expense.html) of a small number of large tech companies. 


### In This Class

- Work that you submit in this class must demonstrate **your** learning and understanding. Copy/paste from LLMs like ChatGPT does not do this, and is consequently a violation of academic integrity. 
- You are **discouraged** from using ChatGPT in any way on warmups. The reason is that warmups help you with the quizzes; if you don't practice on the warmups, you'll do worse and get a lower grade. 
- Quizzes are in-class assessments on which electronics are prohibited. This implies that ChatGPT is **prohibited** on quizzes. 
- You are free to **consult** ChatGPT (or other LLMs) when studying and when completing lab reports. If you do, **you must treat ChatGPT as an unverified source**. This means: 
    - You must cite your source. 
    - You must describe the contribution of the source to your submitted writeup. 
    - You may paraphrase but may not quote ChatGPT. 
    - **You must describe what steps you have taken to check that your findings from ChatGPT are indeed correct**.
- You are always personally responsible for the accuracy, quality, and integrity of your work.  


# Inclusion, Access, and Participation

I commit to an inclusive, accessible, participatory, and safe vision of CSCI 0200. 

## Disabilities and Clearing Barriers

[For legal reasons, I am prohibited from offering accommodations to students who do not present letters of accommodation from the DRC. So, get a letter if you need it!]{.aside}

If you have a documented disability that raises barriers for your ability to participate in or succeed in this class, please send me your letter of accommodation from the [Disability Resource Center](https://www.middlebury.edu/disability-resource-center) as soon as possible. **You do not need to describe your disability or justify your accommodations**. I will work with you to clear these barriers to the best of my ability. If you think that you may have a disability, please contact the [Disability Resource Center](https://www.middlebury.edu/disability-resource-center) as soon as possible. The DRC works with students confidentially and never discloses disability-related information to faculty without your permission. 

## Academic Support

No matter who you are, it's normal to feel challenged by your courses. It's also normal to need help! There are many ways for you to get help in CSCI 0200. 

- My [Student Hours](#logistics-and-key-highlights) are time for you to come talk with me about any aspect of the course. We'll usually hold Student Hours in the big lounge outside Room 224 (the one with the windows).
- Experienced CS students hold [Peer Help hours](https://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~mlinderman/courses/cshelp/spring23.html) most weekday evenings. These sessions are great times for you to work on Warmup problems (before class) and lab reports. 
- Our Assistant in Instruction (ASI) is Smith Gakuya. Smith holds regular Student Hours many days, and is prepared to help you in CSCI 0200. Smith can also help you arrange **tutoring** in case you need long-term academic support. 
- EdStem is our online Q&A forum. It's the best place to ask questions at irregular hours. It's a good idea to check EdStem frequently, because your question may already have been answered there! 

## Classroom Environment

Inclusion, access, and participation are **collective** projects. I expect all students to contribute to a healthy course environment. 

We embrace diversity of age, background, beliefs, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and other visible and non-visible axes of identity. **Discrimination is not tolerated in CSCI 0200**. Observed speech acts of discimination may lead to engagement with the Community Standards Office. 

You deserve to be addressed in the manner that reflects who you are. I welcome to tell me your pronouns and/or preferred name at any time, either in person or via email. **I expect all students to address each other according to their expressed gender markers**, and commit to doing the same. 

You deserve to fully and equitably participate in our learning environment. I commit to ensuring that the materials and assessments in this course are accessible to all students, and I welcome feedback on where I can do better. Middlebury's [Disability Resource Center](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/disability-resource-center) can help you remove barriers to learning in this and other courses. 

You deserve a learning environment free from gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you experience these behaviors or otherwise know of a Title IX violation, you have many options for support and/or reporting. Middlebury's [Civil Rights and Title IX Office](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/title-IX) (CRTIX) can help you navigate your options.  Please be aware that I am a Responsible Employee, which means that **I am required by the College to report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual violence to CRTIX**. There are  resources for emotional and mental health care, advocacy, and academic support listed [here](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/sites/www.middlebury.edu.office/files/2021-09/bathroom_poster_2021_proofed(1).pdf?fv=DlkQYWaU), some of which are confidential. 






## We Can Help You Borrow a Laptop

An especially important resource for access in many courses in the Department of Computer Science is a functioning laptop. If you ever find yourself temporarily in need of a laptop, we have 10 rotating Windows laptops that we can loan you.  To request a laptop for **short-term use** (like a single class period), email me as soon as possible. 

**On Long-Term Use**: College policy has changed recently to include the expectation that every student have a laptop available. The college provides laptops to those who need them where “need” is based on Student Financial Services calculations. If you anticipate needing a laptop for the whole term, we encourage you to inquire with Student Financial Services and the library first due to our smaller pool of equipment. If, however, the College will not be able to meet your needs in a timely fashion, please reach out to us so that we can work out a long-term laptop loan. 

# Beyond This Course

## General Advice 

I am always happy to talk with you about your future plans, including internships, research opportunities, and graduate school applications. Because I am a creature of the academy, I am less knowledgeable about industry jobs, although you are welcome to ask about those too. You can drop in during Student Hours or email me to make an appointment. 

## Letters of Recommendation 

Writing letters of recommendation for students is a fundamental part of my job and something that I am usually very happy to do. [Here's how to ask me for a letter](https://www.philchodrow.com/for-students.html#advice-and-recommendation-letters). 

# Acknowledgments

The assessment system for this course is closely modeled on [Peter-Michael Osera](https://osera.cs.grinnell.edu/)'s offering of [CSC 208-01: Discrete Mathematics](https://osera.cs.grinnell.edu/csc208/) at Grinnell College.

I learned of many of the videos and readings used in this course from [Chad Topaz](https://chadtopaz.com/)'s offering of [MATH-200: Discrete Mathematics](https://glow.williams.edu/courses/3011771) at Williams College.

My approach to Bloom's taxonomy and assignments/class time is inspired by [this blog post](https://rtalbert.org/re-thinking-blooms-taxonomy-for-flipped-learning-design/) by Robert Talbert. 

Many learning targets are adapted from Robert Talbert's targets from [an offering](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/BkwQboPzY) of MTH 225: Discrete Mathematics at Grand Valley State University.
